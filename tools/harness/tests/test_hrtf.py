"""The HRTF of dsound_sdl.c against the Xbox's (hrtf.c): the time between the ears, their levels apart in each
octave, the pinna's notch and what a sound behind loses, over a grid of directions.

    python tools/harness/tests/test_hrtf.py metrics   our figures, beside the Xbox's
(MIXER_SOURCE=path: of another dsound_sdl.c, to compare)

The Xbox's figures in hrtf.c were measured on the Xbox's own filters, which this repository does not hold: the
XDK DirectSound linked into the game's default.xbe, once the game calls DirectSoundUseFullHRTF, works out each
voice's azimuth and elevation (45 degrees times the ratio of the lesser side over the greater in each octant),
rounds them to its grid (6 degrees of elevation; 3, 6 or 12 of azimuth as the elevation rises), and looks up a
pair of 31-tap filters with a whole-frame delay between the ears, which it writes to the MCPX's voice processor
(NV1BA0_PIO_SET_HRIR). Each tap is a byte: a sign, a 3-bit exponent and a 4-bit mantissa (the magnitude the
mantissa below 16, else 16 plus it, doubled each exponent past the first). To measure them again from one's own
default.xbe: find DirectSoundUseFullHRTF (it stores its lookup's address for the 3D calculator to call), run that
lookup as it is (x86, stdcall: azimuth, elevation, the fold behind (off: DirectSound sets it only for Dolby
Surround and Dolby Digital), and two pointers it sets to the left and
right ears' filters) for each direction of hrtf.c's grid with the fold off, make each ear's response at 48 kHz
from its 31 taps decoded, after its delay (the filter's last byte: the left ear's when the sound is to the
right), 512 frames each, and give them to "measure" (raw floats, in the grid's order) for its line of
xbox_figures.
