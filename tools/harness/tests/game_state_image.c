/*
GAME_STATE_IMAGE.C (test)

The game state's image (saved games/game_state.c): a checkpoint's holds the
part of the game state in use, the CPU's allocations then the GPU's, the
bytes of the game state there; taken back, those are what the game state
had, from it or from an image of the whole game state (an older build's
file, a core, Save and Quit's), what is checked is found at the same place
in both, and an image of another size is refused. test_game_state_image.py
takes the code from the sources; the game state and its allocations are
the test's.
