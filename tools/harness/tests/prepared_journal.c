/* A map's preparation's record (port/linux/src/d3d8_device.c's journal,
port/linux/game/render_prepared.c): the entries read back are the entries
recorded, a repeat once, in their order, with the textures and pages between
them; pages recorded under one platform's page size (4 KB, 16 KB on Apple's
hardware) are played back under the other's as exactly the pages that hold
them; malformed words are refused; a record whose draws the played back ones
do not all have under its own derivation, or that is another form's or
map's, is refused, and its key holds no setting; one record, made under any
settings, played back under any others, makes every draw those settings
would have walked. */
