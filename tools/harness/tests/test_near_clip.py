"""The near clip plane of the local players' views (port/linux/game/near_clip.c's render_near_clip_distance): the
game's own at the stock view and any whose corners are within the reach (the cyborg's collision radius), so the
default is drawn as ever; nearer at a wider view, its farthest corner at the reach, so a wall beside the player is
not cut (#604); from the game's own frustum bounds (split screen's views off their middles). And where it is wired:
the render camera and the rasterizer's, from the whole view's bounds, not the VR mode's eyes."""
